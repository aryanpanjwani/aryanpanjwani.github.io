                <p class="mb-5">(Un)fortunately, I have a habit of dabbling in one too many hobbies at a time. Here are
                    a few of my current favorites, followed by an assortment of some pictures. </p>

                        style="text-align: left; margin-top: 5px; min-height: 170px !important; overflow-y: auto;">I
                        started playing
                        basketball when I was pretty young and have been fortunate to be able to continue to do so. I've 
                        mostly played recreationally. It's very calming as once you're on the court, nothing else
                        really comes to mind.
                        Also, it's a pretty social activity. I
                        often find myself talking to my opponents and meeting people I haven't seen in some time.
                    </div>

                        style="text-align: left; margin-top: 5px; min-height: 170px !important; overflow-y: auto;">I
                        took piano lessons when I was very young, but only
                        for a little bit. I remember nearly nothing other than the note names. Recently, I've gotten
                        back into it. I still can't really play anything, so please don't ask lol. It's tough to find
                        time to learn and practice with schoolwork, clubs, etc, but I try to make time here and there
                        because I think it's such an elegant instrument that I want to pick up.</div>
                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="smash" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="smash-tab"
                        style="text-align: left; margin-top: 5px; min-height: 170px !important; overflow-y: auto;">I
                        first played Super Smash Bros on my friend's switch
                        after my AP Gov final my senior year of HS. I never played too much until this past semester.
                        I've found it to be such an enjoyable pastime, since it's a very social game that a lot of
                        people I know tend to play. Although, it can get very competitive at times, I often find myself
                        developing strong connections sitting on a couch alongside a group of friends engaging in
                        friendly banter as we aim to launch each other off of the stage.</div>
                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="chess" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="chess-tab"
                        style="text-align: left; margin-top: 5px; min-height: 170px !important; overflow-y: auto;">I am
                        alright at Chess. After playing it a few times
                        in 4th Grade, I picked it back up recently. Before you ask, my rating is like 900 on a good
                        day. I intentionally have chosen to not go down the rabbit hole and learn openings, tactics,
                        etc. I currently enjoy hopping on Chess.com, getting obliterated, and continuing about my day.

                        shaping up to be my most pivotal experience in product management. And who would have thought
                        I'd find myself in the Midwest? Living in Lincoln has been a fascinating experience. There's a

                        sense of appreciation for the city's unique charm and the warm community that surrounds it.</p>

                                    pushed me to learn so much more about how the blockchain, NFTs, and crypto works.
                                    I've been less active recently, but I will be more involved this coming semester.

                            Let me give you some of the backstory. I came across a TikTok of a <a
                                href="https://www.productbase.io/">website</a> that had some great information about the
                            product space. I was fascinated and wanted to learn more, so I reached out to <a
                                href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericyang-ey/">Eric Yang</a> (the creator). We hopped
                            on a facetime and talked for a bit, but then an idea hit me. I asked if I could reformat
                            some of his original content into quick YouTube videos and add a few of my personal
                            philosophies and thoughts as well. After a few months passed, I'd finally finished the
                            series and now it's available for everyone, so check it out!

                            This course is infamously know throughout UT's McCombs as "Killer K". For the final project
                            in this class, we were tasked with creating <strong>
                                a C#-based ASP.NET MVC website purposed for
                                managing student job/internship recruiting with a SQL

                            </br>
                            </br>
                            The system we created has three roles: students, recruiters, and CSO staff. Students can
                            apply for positions and attend interviews, recruiters can create jobs and interview
                            students, and CSO staff manage the entire process and serve as super users for the system.
                            This project required >100 total hours of coding, debugging, testing.
                            </br>
                            </br>

                            experience taught me a lot about myself in terms of grit and resilience. In the end, we
                            managed to win 2nd place out of the 33 competing teams. Check out the site and login as a
                            CSO to get the full experience:

                            Here's the context of how the idea came to fruition. During my time with Wells Fargo
                            Advisors, a fellow intern and I were tasked with creating a comprehensive list of potential
                            leads for a financial advisor, and the person who came up with a longer and better list
                            would win a free lunch. My competitive mind began working and I came up with the idea to
                            create this as it leveraged my time now for unlimited use in the future and I wanted to get
                            some practice in because I had just picked up programming the semester before.

                            By the deadline, I had easily won the competition by about 1300 leads and my fellow intern
                            and I laughed about it because I had told her my plan. More importantly, I got to practice
                            coding, and give me the confidence to build other projects on my own.

                            During the semester this was created, I wanted to test my skills as an entreprenuer...and I
                            needed money to pay my tuition. I realized I needed no startup capital, so I learned
                            how the business model works and quickly began at finding different niches and creating
                            designs to appeal to these audiences.

                            Despite not finding initial success, I kept at it while learning more about what designs
                            were legally available and how to write merchandise titles and descriptions that gave my
                            styles the best chance of being shown in search results. Naturally, as the holiday season
                            came around, so did my sales and I was able to pay my semester's tuition along with learning
                            a ton about ecommerce.

                            I created my first personal website because it was an assignment for my web development
                            course. There were certain requirements that I had to meet on there. Since it was the first
                            assignment, I didn't really have any knowledge about HTML/CSS other than extreme basics.
                            Regardless, it was one of my favorite homework assignments that I'd ever done, so once
                            summer started, I began working and eventually published <strong>this website</strong>. They
                            recently
                            deactivated the hosting for our old sites, but if you really want to check it out, let me

            <p>I consider volunteering a core value. My mom always pushed it growing up, and I'm very thankful for it
                because I feel it's given me a deeper sense of gratitude in life. I have a personal goal to volunteer
                "around the world", but more so in every place I stay
                for an extended period of time. Here's a few:</p>
